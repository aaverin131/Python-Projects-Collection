# Monty Hall
#### The famous problem with 3 doors. 
 Monty has 3 doors but only behind one of them there is a car. The player has a chance to win by picking one of the doors. Initially the player has 1/3 chance. Then, the Monty reveals one of the other doors that doesn't have a car and asks the player whether they want to switch.

Initially I've learned about the problem in my Discrete Structers course, but since then I've been curious whether it's statistically accurate (e.g. 33% to 66% chance), or if it is actually 50-50 chance (spoiler: it's not)
